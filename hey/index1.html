          <h1>Fast Burger in the West</h1>
          <p>In 1948, little did people know that the 15 cents hamburger down the countryside of California would become the best selling burger in the world. With efficient self-service and cheap meals offered at McDonalds, it soon attracted many customers to try this famous burger. The business went great for McDonalds, in 1953, the brothers had expanded their business with the approach of franchising. Yet, what truly this restaurant was not until one guy, Ray Krock, who saw the potential of the company, he decided to join the chain in 1954 to expand the restaurant with full of ambition and dreams. Later on, he had carried the restaurant to become a brand who no one would not know of. David Edgerton saw this business doing well, he also wanted to open a burger place. In 1954, Insta-Burger King was founded.</p>

          <h3 class="date">1971</h3>
          <h1>Have It Your Way</h1>
          <p>Mcdonald’s campaign in 1971 called “you deserve a break campaign” boosted its sales by not just showing the burgers but also appealing Mcdonald's as the place and the brand.
In 1972, they opened the first restaurant in Japan and within a month it became the best performing franchise. Burger King’s attempt to enter Japanese market was turned down by Pillsbury wanting low risk expansion, and it widened the gaps between rivals. 
Burger King’s campaign to differentiate from Mcdonald’s, “ have it your way” boosted its sales and got them back to the game. However, Burger king was sued by Burger Chef for violating their “have it your way” trademark. 
In 1976, Mcdonald introduced the breakfast offerings, which boosted its revenue more than 15%. At this time, Mcdonald’s were four times bigger than Burger King.

          <h1>Battle of the Burgers</h1>
          <p>Mcdonald’s introduced Chicken Mcnugget to respond to the trend of American who started to be more health conscious and eat more chicken, and it became the best selling menu.  
Burger king started attacking directly to the other burger brands with comparative campaign advertisements called “the battle of burgers”. This campaign was set fire with a TV commercial which claims that Burger king’s burgers outperformed those of Mcdonald’s by taste tests. Burger king generated tons of free publicity under the legal attacks and increased sales up to 40%. The constant ads with huge costs, however, started impacting on its management and led to decreasing the sales. They ended up laying off a third of the company's employees

          <h3 class="date">2002</h3>
          <h1>Super Fan Supernova</h1>
          <p>Things have gone wrong at McDonald's. At the end of November 2002, the company recorded its first loss since it was listed on the stock exchange. Due to McDonald's becoming the symbol of junk food, like in Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super size me. It is therefore urgent for the emperor of fast food to review his identity.
The marketing director of the brand Larry Light travelled the world to gather ideas. It is in Munich, Germany where advisors came up with the slogan "Ich liebe es” (I like it in German) to describe how a visit to McDonald's is one of life's simple pleasures, and with the now iconic sound “Ba Da, Ba Ba Ba Ba”. The slogan "I'm lovin’ it" became international and Justin Timberlake presented McDonald's new identity to the world in September 2003.
McDonald's was revamped with a new brand identity and an improved menu among other changes. The company came out of the red and both sales and share prices rose again.  
</p>

<p>For Burger King, its sales were declining, and Wendy's is about to take its place as the second largest fast food chain in America. Burger King knows that only a radical change will allow it to keep its title. How? By creating a buzz to make a lasting impression. For the launch of their new chicken sandwich on April 7, 2004, Burger King discreetly put the "obedient chicken" online: a webcam image of a man wearing a chicken suit standing in a living room. Underneath, a text box where the web user can type in instructions that the chicken man would execute (If he types "moonwalk" then the chicken man will do this dance step). The employees of Burger King sent the link by e-mail to a few friends. And by word of mouth, the site already had a million visitors withing twenty-four hours.
Burger King and its advertising agency multiplied the offbeat campaigns to widen the gap with Wendy's. 
</p>

<p>But the economic crisis of 2008 put the burger chains in another difficult position. As the crisis greatly impacted customers into not having purchasing power anymore.

          <h3 class="date">Today</h3>
          <h1>Breakfast Wars</h1>
          <p>Breakfast represents an important market for the fast-food chains, as this is the only meal where consumers stick to a routine of consuming the same thing, whereas people tend to experiment more during lunch or dinner. Therefore, keeping customers coming for breakfast is essential, and McDonald’s numbers say it all, breakfast constitutes 25% of their overall sales and is more profitable than their core products. But there has been a lot of new entrants causing scattering of customers and slowdown of their sales. Resulting in Burger King and McDonald’s competing over prices and propose more operations. 
</p>
<p>There has been an overall slowdown of consumption, not only for fast-food chains but for restaurant in general due to the rise of eating and cooking at home. To counter that, restaurants already picked up on the trend by being more up to date for their consumers and proposing order mobile app for Burger King and partnership with Uber for McDonald’s.
</p>
<p>We can expect that in the near future, the eating habits will continue to change, and people won’t have to leave their house anymore, there will be no need to have fast-casual restaurants with a seating space to dine-in. They will likely be replaced by ghost kitchens or centralized kitchens for pick-ups or delivery, and even the means of delivery may change to drones or self-driving cars. 
The business war between McDonald’s and Burger King will still continue and not look the same, or new business wars between Chipotle and Shake Shack may arise.

			Burger king’s campaign “battle of burgers” reminds me of one Japanese proverb,“the crafty schemer drowns in his own scheme” (策士策に溺れる), meaning you will end up with failure if you depend too much on your strategies with overconfidence.
